**Problem:** MySQL does not call the getsockname function, so theres no way of knowing the desition address of queries.

**Solution:** Just rely on the container IP from container cgroup map. This does mean however that I've had to change `socket.ProcessGetsocknameEvent()` so that it only checks if the port is zero for overwriting the address of the socket.

**Update 2025-02-01**

I introduced a check in socket_common.go which checked if either the source port or destination port was zero, if it was then it would buffer the flow until it received a getsockanme event:
```go
if socket.hasZeroPortDest() || socket.hasZeroPortSource() {
```

However this introduced an issue for Python requests to /second_http endpoint in the megaserver: those flows have a source IP set but a zero source port. So it was buffering those flows and then never received a getsockname event so we just never received the flows at all. The solution here was simple: we dont really care about the source port anyway so I removed the `socket.hasZeroPortSource()` check and am now only checking the destination port.
