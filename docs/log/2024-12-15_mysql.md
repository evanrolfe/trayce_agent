**Problem:** MySQL does not call the getsockname function, so theres no way of knowing the desition address of queries.

**Solution:** Just rely on the container IP from container cgroup map. This does mean however that I've had to change `socket.ProcessGetsocknameEvent()` so that it only checks if the port is zero for overwriting the address of the socket.
