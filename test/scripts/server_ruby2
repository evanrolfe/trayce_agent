=begin
    WEBrick is a Ruby library that makes it easy to build an HTTP server with Ruby.
    It comes with most installations of Ruby by default (itâ€™s part of the standard library),
    so you can usually create a basic web/HTTP server with only several lines of code.

    The following code creates a generic WEBrick server on the local machine on port 1234,
    shuts the server down if the process is interrupted (often done with Ctrl+C).
    This example lets you call the URL's: "add" and "subtract" and pass through arguments to them
    Example usage:
        http://localhost:1234/ (this will show the specified error message)
        http://localhost:1234/add?a=10&b=10
        http://localhost:1234/subtract?a=10&b=9
=end

class MyServlet < WEBrick::HTTPServlet::AbstractServlet
    def do_GET (request, response)
        # puts "GET: #{request}"
        response.status = 200
        response.body = "Hello world (from ruby)"
    end
end

server = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:Port => 4122)

server.mount "/", MyServlet

trap("INT") {
    server.shutdown
}

server.start
